# About the Project
This project is a command-line search engine and crawler designed to automate searching for torrent files on 1337x.to. It lets you quickly find torrents for movies, TV shows, and other content by simply providing a search title, saving you time browsing unreliable streaming websites.

# Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following tools installed.

### Docker
Docker is required to run the project in a containerized environment. It enables compatibility across platforms, including Windows.

- **On Ubuntu**, install Docker with the following commands:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg
  sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
  curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
  echo \
    "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
  ```
- **On Windows**, download and install Docker Desktop from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

### Make
Make is used to simplify command execution through the provided `Makefile`. You can also run the commands manually if preferred.

- **On Linux**, install Make with:  
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y make
  ```
- **On Windows**, you can use [GnuWin](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm), or run Make through [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).

### Poetry (Optional)
Poetry is used for dependency management if you choose to run the program locally outside of Docker. This is supported on **Linux systems only**.
  ```bash
  curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
  ```
After installation, ensure Poetry is added to your `PATH`:
  ```bash
  export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
  ```

> [!NOTE] 
> Poetry is not required when using Docker, as all dependencies are already included in the image.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

1. Clone the project.
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Meleagrista/py-torrent-crawler.git
  ```
2. Go to the project directory.
  ```bash
  cd py-torrent-crawler
  ```
3. Make sure **Docker** is installed and the daemon is active.
4. Build the project using **Make**.
  ```bash
  make build
  ```

# Usage
Follow the steps below to get started and use the project effectively.
  ```bash
  make run
  ```
You can modify the parameters `DOWNLOAD_DIR` and `CACHE_DIR` in the `Makefile` to set the download and cache directories, respectively to your desired locations.
You can also change them at runtime by running the command with the following parameters:
  ```bash
  make run DOWNLOAD_DIR=/path/to/download CACHE_DIR=/path/to/cache
  ```

## Environment Variables
You can customize the behavior of the program by setting the following environment variables:

- **`TORRENT_FILES_PER_MOVIE`**  Specifies the default number of torrent files to download per movie.
- **`TORRENT_SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`** Defines the languages that are supported for torrent file downloads.
- **`SELENIUM_LOAD_STRATEGY`** Configures the loading strategy for **Selenium**, which is only relevant if the source website is blocked on your network.  
  - The recommended option is `normal` or you can choose `eager` for faster loading times with increased risk of errors.
- **`TERMINAL_WIDTH`**  Sets the width of the terminal output. Adjust this value to match your terminal size for optimal display.

# Roadmap
The following features and enhancements are planned for development.
- [ ] Add screenshots and a demo to documentation.
- [ ] Add subtitle search by extracting metadata from torrent files.
- [ ] Add alternative torrent sites for scrapping.
- [ ] Improve search functionality to support other media types.
  - [ ] Add support for TV shows and series.
